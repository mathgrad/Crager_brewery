Crager Brewery Interview Project
Part: Frontend
Frameworks used:  React, Redux, SASS

Attempted to use Typescript, but faced difficulties with implementation with redux.  Removed due to time constraints.

End goal:
A single page application (SPA) which allows a user to search for breweries from Open Brewery DB.

Design:
Prompt suer to select an US city
Search Bar for brewery names
Display breweries by 25 count, inside of a table.
Each row consists of Name, Type, Address (Street, City, State, ZIP), Website
Selecting a row opens up additional details with a map to the Brewery
